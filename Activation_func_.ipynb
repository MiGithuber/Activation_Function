    "   - Commonly used in hidden layers to handle data with negative and positive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):**\n",

    "4. **Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU):**\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Leaky ReLU}(x) = \\max(\\alpha x, x) \\]\n",
    "   - Similar to ReLU but allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs.\n",
    "   - Addresses the \"dying ReLU\" problem where neurons can become inactive during training.\n",

    "5. **Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU):**\n",

    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Here are some ways in which activation functions impact neural network training and performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction of Non-linearity:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, enabling it to model complex relationships in the data. Without non-linear activation functions, the entire neural network would behave like a linear model, limiting its capacity to learn and represent intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Descent and Backpropagation:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions influence the gradient descent optimization algorithm and the backpropagation process. The derivative of the activation function is used to compute gradients during backpropagation, which is essential for updating the weights of the network. Well-defined derivatives facilitate efficient and stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Vanishing and Exploding Gradients:**\n",
    "   - Some activation functions, like sigmoid and tanh, are prone to vanishing gradients or exploding gradients, which can hinder the training process. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become extremely small, leading to slow or stalled learning. Exploding gradients happen when gradients become excessively large, causing instability. Activation functions like ReLU help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse Activation:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions like ReLU tend to produce sparse activations, where only a subset of neurons are activated for a given input. This sparsity can result in a more efficient use of resources and a reduced risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Addressing the \"Dying Neuron\" Problem:**\n",
    "   - In some cases, neurons using certain activation functions may become inactive during training and never activate again. This is known as the \"dying neuron\" problem. Activation functions like Leaky ReLU or Parametric ReLU address this issue by allowing a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs, preventing neurons from becoming entirely inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Learning Capacity:**\n",
    "   - Different activation functions may affect the learning capacity of a neural network. Some activation functions, such as ELU, have been designed to capture more complex patterns in data and mitigate issues like the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Task-specific Considerations:**\n",
    "   - The choice of activation function often depends on the specific task and characteristics of the data. For example, sigmoid and softmax functions are suitable for binary and multi-class classification tasks, respectively, while ReLU and its variants are commonly used in hidden layers for general tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selection of activation functions influences the expressive power, stability, and training dynamics of a neural network. It is often an important aspect of neural network architecture design and requires careful consideration based on the characteristics of the task and the data being processed. Experimentation and tuning are common practices to find the most effective activation functions for a given neural network."

For example, in logistic regression, the sigmoid function is often used to model the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.\n",

    "1. **Output Interpretability:** The output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as a probability, making it suitable for binary classification problems.\n",

    "2. **Smooth Gradient:** The sigmoid function has a smooth derivative, which facilitates stable and continuous updates during the backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Historical Significance:** The sigmoid function has a long history of use in neural networks and machine learning, and it has been a standard activation function in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Sigmoid Activation Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient Problem:** The sigmoid function saturates for extreme values of input, causing the gradient to become very small. This can lead to the vanishing gradient problem, where the network has difficulty learning and updating the weights during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not Centered Around Zero:** The sigmoid function outputs values in the range (0, 1), and its mean is not centered around zero. This can lead to issues in weight updates during training, especially when stacking multiple layers in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Scaled Between 0 and 1:** The output of the sigmoid function is strictly positive, and it scales inputs between 0 and 1. This may not be suitable for activation in hidden layers, where a broader range of activations is often desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its disadvantages, the sigmoid activation function is less commonly used in hidden layers of deep neural networks today. Alternatives like the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants are often preferred for hidden layers due to their ability to address the vanishing gradient problem and provide faster convergence during training."

    "Using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function over the sigmoid function offers several benefits, particularly in the context of training deep neural networks. Here are some key advantages of using ReLU:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigation of Vanishing Gradient Problem:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid functions are prone to the vanishing gradient problem, especially for extreme input values, leading to slow or stalled learning. ReLU helps mitigate this problem for positive input values because its derivative is either 1 or 0, preventing the gradients from becoming too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Faster Convergence:**\n",
    "   - ReLU activation typically leads to faster convergence during training. The non-saturating, piecewise linear nature of ReLU ensures that neurons can learn more quickly compared to sigmoid, which may saturate and slow down learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparse Activation:**\n",
    "   - ReLU tends to produce sparse activations, where only a subset of neurons are activated for a given input. This sparsity can lead to more efficient computation and memory usage, as well as a reduction in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - ReLU is computationally more efficient than the sigmoid function. The simple max function used in ReLU involves fewer computational operations compared to the exponential function in the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoidance of Sigmoid Biases:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid outputs are biased towards the middle of the range (between 0 and 1), which may hinder the weight update process during training. ReLU, on the other hand, outputs values greater than or equal to zero, avoiding such biases and making weight updates more effective."

    "The softmax activation function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. Its primary purpose is to convert a vector of raw, real-valued scores (logits) into a probability distribution over multiple classes. The softmax function ensures that the sum of the probabilities for all classes is equal to 1, making it suitable for tasks where an input belongs to one and only one class.\n",
